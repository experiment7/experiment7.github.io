<p>I am presently working as Deep Learning Scientist at Predible Health, here,I work on the the research and development of Predible's core Imaging platform wherein we have build state of the art segmentation algorithms/models in Computer Vision. I have previously taken workshop at IIT-Bombay Techfest, I have spoken at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University at their SFD celebrations and at MuPy (Manipal Institute of Technology's annual Python Conference), Kongu University and a few other colleges/Universities. I have been a constant contributor in the open source world and have been attending PyCon and other conferences every year.
